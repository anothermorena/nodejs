Middleware

Middleware in Express.js is a function that executes during the request-response cycle. 
It can perform a variety of tasks such as parsing incoming request data, handling
authentication, and modifying the response before it is sent to the client. Middleware
functions are executed in the order they are defined, and can either pass control to 
the next middleware function or end the request-response cycle. Express.js includes 
built-in middleware for tasks such as parsing JSON and handling static files, and
developers can also create their own custom middleware.

A middleware is really anything between the request and the response. Route handlers
we created in the previous chapter are middleware too. There re three types of middleware.
There is built-in, custom and third party middlewares. The custom middleware is what we create 
ourselves.
